# To what value does the following expression evaluate?

'12' < '9'

# True. It will go character by character from left to right, so the '1' in '12' is evaluated 
# against the '9' and '1' is less than '9'. It ends there because there is nothing after '9'. If 
# numbers were used instead of strings, it would evaluate to False.
